### Assign Numbers in Minesweeper

Implement a function that assigns correct numbers in a field of Minesweeper, which is represented as a 2 dimensional array.

### Example

The size of the field is 3x4, and there are bombs at the positions [0, 0] (row index = 0, column index = 0) and [0, 1] (row index = 0, column index = 1)

Then, the resulting field should be:

```
[[-1, -1, 1, 0], 
[2, 2, 1, 0], 
[0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
