### N-th Element of a Linked List

Implement a function that finds the nth node in a linked list, counting from the end

Your function should take a linked list (its head element) and n, a positive integer as its arguments

### Examples:

head -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null
The third element of head counting from the end is 3.

head2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null
The fourth element of head2 counting from the end is 1.

If the given n is larger than the number of nodes in the list, return null.
