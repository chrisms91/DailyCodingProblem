### Is This Binary Search Tree?

Write a function that takes a binary tree and returns true if it is a binary search tree, and false if not.

### Examples

head1 = 0
       / \
      1   2
     / \ / \
    3  4 5  6

=> head1 is NOT a binary search tree


head2 = 3
      /   \
     1     5
    / \   / \
   0   2 4   6

=> head2 is binary search tree.
